Description: Sometimes in a workplace it is hard to know exactly where or when a 
    specific chart has been produced. This is especially true when someone has copied 
    a chart out of a report to use somewhere else. The `ggtrack` package aims to 
    solve this problem by embedding enough metadata in the charts image to identify 
    the source and the exact time it was produced.
